# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio Website** — a simple yet interactive showcase of who I am and what I can do, built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**. 🎨💻

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🌐 **HTML** — Structure of the website
- 🎨 **CSS** — Styling the elements for layout and responsiveness

I followed a structured **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** approach:

2. 📊 **Analysis** — Identifying the tools and content needed
3. 🎨 **Design** — Creating the layout and design mockups
4. 💻 **Development** — Coding the website using HTML and CSS
5. 🧪 **Testing** — Ensuring all links, layouts, and animations work properly
6. 🚀 **Deployment** — Hosting the site for public access
7. 🔄 **Maintenance** — Continuous updates and improvements
